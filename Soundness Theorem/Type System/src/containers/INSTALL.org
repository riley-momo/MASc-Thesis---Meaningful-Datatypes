#+TITLE: Installation Guide.

Containers should work with any idris version.

To install you can run the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  make install
#+END_SRC

There are other commands provided by the `Makefile`.

Idris container's currently depends on a separate package called
testing. I am hoping to migrate the testing code to the one I
contributed to `contrib` a couple of moons ago. In that time you will
need to install idris-testing.

The shell script `fetch-deps.sh` should fetch the deps for you and
build the script locally. I use this script when testing the package
with travis. You will manually have to install testing.

Sorry about that.
