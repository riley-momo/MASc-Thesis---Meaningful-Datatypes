% Cardinality Axiom 1: The cardinality of a geopolitical at a timepoint is unqiuely a natural number
(all gp all t (geopolitical_entity(gp) & timepoint(t) <-> nat(cardinality(gp,t)))).

% Cardinality Axiom 2: Cardinality of a geopolitical entity is at least one for timepoints inside an occupation
(all gp all t (geopolitical_entity(gp) & timepoint(t) ->
    (lesser(zero_cardinality, cardinality(gp,t)) <->
        (exists o exists gs (occupation_of(o, gs, gp) & between(start_of(o), t, end_of(o))))))).

% Cardinality Axiom 3: Cardinality ordering definition in terms of geopolitical mereology
(all gp1 all gp2 all t (lesser(cardinality(gp1,t), cardinality(gp2,t)) ->
    (exists gp3 (subgeopol(gp3,gp2,t) & (cardinality(gp3,t) = cardinality(gp1,t)))))).
